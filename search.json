We are co-developing the ecosystem model MuSICA as well as the global land surface models CABLE-POP and ISBA.\nWe develop innovative methods to process high-resolution flux data and use them to understand ecosystem processes. We are currently investigating the coordination between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, plant access to water sources, and the link between soil water and stomata through water transport within trees (plant hydraulics). We use data from our eddy covariance site FR-Hes, from other ICOS ecosystem sites, and from FLUXNET.\nWe are testing ideas in the ecosystem model MuSICA, then check their large-scale consequences with the global land surface models CABLE-POP and ISBA.

Coordinated by Jean-Marc LIMOUSIN (CEFE)\n\n\n\n\n\nForests are both strongly impacted by the on-going climate change and at the heart of the mitigation strategies, thereby urging the scientists and forest managers to better anticipate how the forest carbon cycle will be affected under future climate. In Drought-ForC, we identify three main scientific issues that are currently limiting our understanding of climate change effects on forest’s carbon sequestration. The first one relates to the allocation of carbon among the different tree organs and the link between carbon photosynthetic assimilation and sequestration in perennial tree biomass.

In addition, in western central Europe and the Mediterranean area, climate models predict a likely increase in edaphic droughts in the coming decades.

Therefore, we need comprehensive approaches and interdisciplinary research to take into account the hydrological and hydrogeological parameters of the critical zone in the response of forests to water deficit.\nFor a long time, the so-called “available water content” (AWC, in millimetres of water) has been identified as a key parameter in the modelling of forest water balance, carbon balance, tree growth and survival. Yet, the concept of AWC has two main drawbacks that question its relevance in a context of increasing water deficit, particularly in the case of forests. First, the estimation of AWC is classically based on integrating pedotransfer functions over depth of 1 to 2-meters. This considerably underestimates the capacity of trees to grow roots much deeper (down to 5-10 m in the temperate and Mediterranean zones). Challenging the AWC concept, recent works have defined the Total Available Water (TAW) concept, that adds “deep water” extraction by trees to AWC. However, this deep-water resource remains poorly quantified because the soil volume actually explored by roots is unknown. Second, the estimation of AWC is typically done at the scale of a forest stand, and does not consider the large spatial heterogeneity of its soil. A consequence of this heterogeneity is that the access to soil water can vary greatly among individual trees in a forest, mirroring the large inter-individual variability in terms of functioning18 and vulnerability to water stress that is often observed but more rarely explained, and could contribute to the forest resilience to climate extremes. At a larger spatial scale, evidence is increasing that the access to deep water (hence the estimation of TAW) will be central in the forecast of the functioning and vulnerability of temperate and Mediterranean forests to ongoing climate change.\nIn this context, the TAW-tree project (Fig. 1) aims (1) to quantify the TAW reserve in forest plots through a combination of geophysical (WP1) and ecophysiological (WP2) approaches, (2) to upscale TAW at regional scale using remote sensing (WP3) in order to (3) quantify the influence of TAW on the functioning, growth and vulnerability of temperate and Mediterranean forests facing climate change (WP4). Our working hypotheses are (hypothesis 1) that AWC generally underestimates TAW, often in a considerable way in forests, (hypothesis 2) that the variations of TAW in a particular forest drive a large part of the inter-tree differences in their response to water shortage, (hypothesis 3) that TAW, and particularly its deep component, has a critical role in the functioning and vulnerability of forests exposed to heat and drought stresses and that it changes the forests’ contribution to groundwater discharge."

Coordinated by Marianne Clausel (IECL) and Matthias Cuntz (Silva)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants are using CO2 to grow. Rising CO2 concentrations due to human emissions should hence lead to enhanced plant productivity, counteracting partly future climate change. Plants also die and decompose so that ecosystems also respire CO2. Only a tiny fraction of about 2% of gross plant productivity (GPP) finally stays in the ecosystem. It is this tiny fraction that is “seen” by the atmosphere, which integrates all sources (e.g. human emissions and respiration, Resp) and sinks (e.g. GPP). Small changes of the gross fluxes GPP or Resp can hence lead to very large variations in atmospheric CO2 and thus its radiative forcing.\nLand surface models (LSMs) encode our knowledge of the processes behind plant productivity GPP and respiration Resp, and are used in projections of future climate change. It is, however, inherently difficult to assess model parameters, for example, for the water and nutrient status at each point on Earth and on the large grid sizes used by the LSMs. But it is also not well known how the processes encoded in LSMs will develop with rising CO2 and under a changing climate. For example, large-scale experiments on the change of GPP with rising CO2 showed mixed results due to diverse water and nutrient effects. Current LSMs have thus chosen very different approaches to describe the change of GPP and they show consequently a large spread in projections of the land carbon sink in the coming century.\nHence, we propose an innovative data-driven approach to provide in-depth informations about how processes can be improved in LSMs. Instead of building a traditional data-driven model for predicting the GPP, we will build a data-driven representation of the LSM that mirror its processes and their interactions, i.e. has the same causal structure.

Coordinated by Marianne Clausel (IECL) and Matthias Cuntz (Silva)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants are using CO2 to grow. Rising CO2 concentrations due to human emissions should hence lead to enhanced plant productivity, counteracting partly future climate change. Plants also die and decompose so that ecosystems also respire CO2. Only a tiny fraction of about 2% of gross plant productivity (GPP) finally stays in the ecosystem. It is this tiny fraction that is “seen” by the atmosphere, which integrates all sources (e.g. human emissions and respiration, Resp) and sinks (e.g. GPP). Small changes of the gross fluxes GPP or Resp can hence lead to very large variations in atmospheric CO2 and thus its radiative forcing.\nLand surface models (LSMs) encode our knowledge of the processes behind plant productivity GPP and respiration Resp, and are used in projections of future climate change. It is, however, inherently difficult to assess model parameters, for example, for the water and nutrient status at each point on Earth and on the large grid sizes used by the LSMs. But it is also not well known how the processes encoded in LSMs will develop with rising CO2 and under a changing climate. For example, large-scale experiments on the change of GPP with rising CO2 showed mixed results due to diverse water and nutrient effects. Current LSMs have thus chosen very different approaches to describe the change of GPP and they show consequently a large spread in projections of the land carbon sink in the coming century.\nHence, we propose an innovative data-driven approach to provide in-depth informations about how processes can be improved in LSMs. Instead of building a traditional data-driven model for predicting the GPP, we will build a data-driven representation of the LSM that mirror its processes and their interactions, i.e. has the same causal structure. By adjusting the expressivity and the dependencies of the surrogate version of each process in the data-driven representation, we will not only inform developers of the LSM which process have predictive limitations but it will also hint on how the process should be improved. This should ultimately lead to improved land surface models and hence more robust projections of future climate change."

    "text": "Funding: Artemis\nPlants regulate their stomata to balance carbon uptake and water release, and to provide a hydraulic safety for the plant tissue, protecting it from cavitation. Stomata respond hence to demand from atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and to pressure from reduced from soil water content (SWC). Current mathematical descriptions of stomatal conductance (gₛ) describe VPD responses and SWC responses independently, but the water potential (Ψ) forms a continuum from the atmosphere through leaf and plant to the soil. This so-called plant hydraulics is currently investigated in land surface models. However, the plant hydraulic models are only very weakly constrained by existing point-wise measurements of leaf water potentials. The proposed project aims to address this gap by leveraging innovative sensor technologies to continuously and simultaneously measure water potential (Ψ) gradients within trees, from trunk to canopy, capturing the dynamic interplay between slow SWC variations and rapid VPD fluctuations. The measurements together with the entire range of observations at the ICOS site FR-Hes will enable the resolution of combined VPD-SWC effects on gₛ. The high- resolution measurements will be used to constrain plant hydraulic models and decide on the most parsimonious description in land surface models."
