In a world where the necessary transition is not occurring fast enough, technological solutions to
the climate crisis are increasingly favoured by decision-makers, but widely debated within the
scientific community. The majority of these solutions are based on climate intervention (CI) methods
that are grouped into two broad categories. Techniques that remove and store atmospheric CO2
(CDR), and techniques to correct the radiative imbalance caused by the accumulation of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by increasing the planet's albedo (SRM).

Current research does not sufficiently quantify the risks and uncertainties of these methods individually, nor their
combined effects. Emissions scenarios for limiting global warming to 2°C include CDR, while the
controversies surrounding SRM exclude it from the framework of future scenarios. In addition, the
(geo)political and social components that will ultimately define the deployment of these techniques
has not included the latest physical science research conducted on these topics. In order to inform
future decisions, we need to account for all possibilities.

The GEOSIC project will combine studies of climate intervention techniques, individually and by studying their interactions, with geopolitical
scenarios that encompass the variety of proposals. GEOSIC will address topics including the
Incorporation of geopolitical scenarios in CI model simulations, the detectability of SRM deployment
and its possible teleconnections; CDR (including ocean-based approaches) efficiency in various
scenarios and its feasibility, carbon stock vulnerability and related uncertainties; interactions
between SRM and CDR to understand their combined potential and synergies/antagonisms. These
physical science questions will be interfaced with geopolitical issues concerning possible
deployment governance; the conflict-generating nature of SRM deployment in a climate
securitization context and the anticipation and prevention of such conflicts; climate injustice and
inequalities linked to the heterogeneous access and deployment capacities of CI techniques; and
their socio-environmental sustainability. Cross-disciplinary actions combining these questions
complete this interdisciplinary project, producing a comprehensive vision of the CI landscape.
Finally, to better predict the regional impacts of climate change and support necessary adaptation
measures, a unique outcome of this project will be to focus on a future France in a new climate
state. This includes France’s CDR needs to attain the national low-carbon trajectory and how SRM
deployment would impact this. The results of the mentioned interdisciplinary studies will be re-
examined at national level, providing an evaluation of the impacts and adaptation to climate change
in the various scenarios.
