**Gabriel Destouet**, Post-Doc.

Gabriel received his PhD in applied mathematics from the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), with a strong focus on wavelet analysis and statistical learning. His doctoral research was conducted in the application domain of cybersecurity at the [CEA](https://www.leti-cea.fr/cea-tech/leti). Following his PhD, he joined the [INRAE-Silva lab](https://www.leti-cea.fr/cea-tech/leti), where he currently works on turbulence in forest ecosystems. His principal objective is to better assess forest ecosystem fluxes. Recently, he contributed to a paper on turbulence analysis, which is available at [EGUsphere](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3243/).
