**Yasin Gundesli**, PhD student.

Yasin is a PhD student in forest ecophysiology at [INRAE Silva](https://www6.nancy.inrae.fr/silva/), under the supervision of Emilie Joetzjer, Matthias Cuntz, and Oliver Brendel. His research investigates how the decoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance affects **carbon and water fluxes** in beech trees (*Fagus sylvatica*), from the **leaf to the whole-tree scale**. Combining field experimentation and modelling, Yasin uses gas exchange measurements collected with instruments such as the **LICOR 6800**, both in greenhouse and forest settings. His work focuses on characterising stomatal and photosynthetic dynamics along the **canopy light gradient** and **throughout the growing season**. By fitting dynamic models to these measurements, he aims to quantify how stomatalâ€“photosynthesis decoupling influences **daily carbon assimilation and transpiration**. This contributes to a better understanding of tree responses to light fluctuations and drought, and of their impact on **water and carbon cycling in beech trees**.
