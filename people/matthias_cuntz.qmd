**Matthias Cuntz**, Directeur de Recherche.

Matthias received his PhD in physics ([Heidelberg](https://www.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/)) and has subsequently been working in atmospheric physics ([Paris](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/)), biology ([Canberra](https://biology.anu.edu.au/)), biogeochemical cycles ([Jena](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/)), and hydrology ([Leipzig](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=34211)). He is PI of the [ICOS](https://www.icos-cp.eu) class 1 ecosystem site [FR-Hes](/fr-hes/icos.qmd) and is key developer of the ecosystem model [MuSICA](https://ecofun.ispa.bordeaux.inrae.fr/index.php/musica-model/) as well as of the global land surface model [CABLE-POP](https://cable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This allows him to combine measurements and modelling to understand and describe mathematically the processes the processes of the exchanges between the biosphere and the atmosphere, scaling from single leaves and greenhouse observations over fluxes measured and modelled at the ecosystem up to the continental and global scale.
