The FastForest group measures and models energy, water, and carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. We are running the <a href="https://www.icos-cp.eu">ICOS</a> class 1 ecosystem site <a href="FR-Hes">FR-Hes</a> with a eddy covariance flux tower and a ton of ancillary measurements. We are co-developping the ecosystem model <a href="https://ecofun.ispa.bordeaux.inrae.fr/index.php/musica-model/">MuSICA</a> as well as the global land surface models <a href="https://cable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">CABLE-POP</a> and <a href="http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article146">ISBA</a>.

We develop innovative methods to process high-resolution flux data and use them to understand <a href="projects#europedrought">ecosystem processes</a>. We are currently investigating the coordination between <a href="projects#slowstom">photosynthesis and stomatal conductance</a>, <a href="projects#tawtree">plants access to water sources</a>, and the link between soil water and stomata through <a href="projects#phydraucc">water transport within trees</a> (plant hydraulics). We use data from our eddy covariance site <a href="FR-Hes">FR-Hes</a>, from <a href="projects#europedrought">other ICOS ecosystem sites</a>, and from FLUXNET.

We are testing ideas in the ecosystem model <a href="https://ecofun.ispa.bordeaux.inrae.fr/index.php/musica-model/">MuSICA</a> and their large-scale consequences with the global land surface models <a href="https://cable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">CABLE-POP</a> and <a href="http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article146">ISBA</a>. We are also looking into using <a href="projects#lsmxai">explainable machine learning to improve process representation</a> in the vegetation models.
