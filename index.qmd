# FastForest

The FastForest group measures and models energy, water, and carbon fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. We are operating the [ICOS](https://www.icos-cp.eu) class 1 ecosystem site [FR-Hes](fr-hes/index.qmd) with a eddy covariance flux tower and a ton of ancillary measurements. We are co-developing the ecosystem model [MuSICA](https://ecofun.ispa.bordeaux.inrae.fr/index.php/musica-model/) as well as the global land surface models [CABLE-POP](https://cable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [ISBA](http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article146).

We develop innovative methods to process high-resolution flux data and use them to understand [ecosystem processes](projects/europedrought.qmd). We are currently investigating the coordination between [photosynthesis and stomatal conductance](projects/slowstom.qmd), [plant access to water sources](projects/taw-tree.qmd), and the link between soil water and stomata through [water transport within trees](projects/phydraucc.qmd) (plant hydraulics). We use data from our eddy covariance site [FR-Hes](fr-hes/index.qmd), from [other ICOS ecosystem sites](projects/europedrought.qmd), and from FLUXNET.

We are testing ideas in the ecosystem model [MuSICA](https://ecofun.ispa.bordeaux.inrae.fr/index.php/musica-model/), then check their large-scale consequences with the global land surface models [CABLE-POP](https://cable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [ISBA](http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article146). We are also looking into using [explainable machine learning to improve process representation](projects/lsmxai.qmd) in the vegetation models.
